              "bodyParagraph": "In the early 20th century, amidst a rapidly modernizing Brazil, a group of Catholic leaders proposed a bold idea: to erect a colossal statue atop Mount Corcovado as a symbol of peace and faith. After years of planning and fundraising, construction began in 1922, culminating in the unveiling of Christ the Redeemer in 1931. Standing 30 meters tall, with arms stretching 28 meters wide, the statue quickly became an emblem of Rio de Janeiro and a testament to the nation's spiritual heritage."

Constructed from reinforced concrete and clad in soapstone, the statue was built to withstand the elements atop the 700-meter-high Corcovado Mountain. The choice of materials and design not only ensured durability but also gave the monument its distinctive, serene appearance."
